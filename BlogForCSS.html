		<h1>Alabama vs. Clemson</h1>
		<section>
		<p>Derrick Henry, O.J. Howard and Kenyan Drake hit No. 1 Clemson with long touchdowns, and No. 2 Alabama outlasted the dynamic play Deshaun Watson to win the College Football Playoff championship 45-40 on Monday night. </p>

		<section>
		<p>The Crimson Tide (14-1) won their three previous championship game appearances in runaway fashion. This game was an instant classic -- a relief for fans who had sat through the blowouts that turned the New Year's Six lineup into a dud. </p>

  		<h1>Documentory "Making a Murderer"</h1>
  		<section>
  		<p>Murderer, martyr and madness. HLN host Nancy Grace faced off against Donnie Wahlberg over Netflix's controversial, headline-making true crime docuseries Making a Murderer on her program on Monday, January 11. </p>
  		</section>
  		<section>
  		<p>Wahlberg, 46, penned an editorial last week for the Chicago Sun-Times about the buzzworthy program — which tells the story of Steven Avery, who was allegedly wrongfully convicted in the murder of Teresa Halbach — and warned viewers to consider that Making a Murderer only presents one side of the argument. In fact, Wahlberg argued that Avery's case was reminiscent of another high-profile '90s trial: O.J. Simpson v. the People. The Blue Bloods actor also controversially defended Avery's nephew Brendan Dassey, who allegedly assisted in the rape and murder of Teresa Halbach. </p>

  		<h1>Key West</h1>
  		<section>
  		<p>Does time ever pass in the Florida Keys? Everyone and everything in Key West seems to go at its own pace, right down to the ice melting slooooowly in your margarita glass. Of course, it’s not all limes and leisure – Key West is known as the “Winter White House” because of its appeal to visiting U.S. presidents, and the island has been home to literary greats like Ernest Hemingway and Tennessee Williams. The diving here is phenomenal, as is the kid-friendly Florida Keys Eco-Discovery Center.</p>
